<h1>Spanning Tree:</h1>
<p>A spanning tree is a subset of Graph G, which has all the vertices covered with minimum possible number of edges.
Hence, a spanning tree does not have cycles and it cannot be disconnected.
<ul>
    <li>Connected</li>
    <li>Undirected</li>
    <li>No Cycle</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h1>Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)</h1>
<p>A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
<ul>
    <li>Weighted + Spanning Tree</li>
</ul>
