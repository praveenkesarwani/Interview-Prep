<h2>Prefix Sum</h2>
<h4>What is Prefix Sum?</h4>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>For every element arr[i], we generate the <b>sum of all elements from 0 to i.</b> We store these values and it is useful in solving such problems</li>
    <li>This sum calculation is done in O(n) time by doing (current_sum = previous_sum + arr[i])</li>
</ul>
