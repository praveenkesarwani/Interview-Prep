/*
problem: container With Most Water

Input consists of n non negative integers a1, a2, ..., an,
where each represents the height of a line. n vertical lines are drawn at 
points 1,2, â€¦ n on the x axis as shown in the diagram. Find two lines,
which together with the x axis forms a container,
such that the container holds the most water.
Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]

Output: 49
